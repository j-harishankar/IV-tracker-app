## Features

- **User Authentication:** Secure sign-in and sign-out for teachers and students using Firebase Authentication.
- **Group Management:** Teachers can create, manage, and delete groups. Students can join groups using a unique code.
- **Role-based Interfaces:** Distinct home pages and navigation tailored for students and teachers.
- **Real-time Updates:** Group information and membership are updated in real time using Cloud Firestore.
- **Modern UI/UX:** Responsive design with a clean, intuitive interface, leveraging Flutter's Material UI and animation support (Lottie).
- **Cross-Platform Support:** Deployable on web, Windows, and Linux platforms.

---

## Architecture Overview

Campus Compass adopts a modular structure following Flutter‚Äôs best practices:
- **`/lib/pages/`:** Contains main UI pages for student and teacher experiences.
- **Platform-specific folders (`/linux`, `/windows`, `/web`):** Manage desktop and web builds via CMake and platform configuration files.
- **Firebase Integration:** Back-end logic is handled via Cloud Functions (see `/functions/index.js`) and real-time data through Firestore.

The application uses a clear separation of concerns, where UI logic, business logic, and platform-specific code are isolated for maintainability and scalability.

---

## Key Components

### 1. Teacher Home Page (`lib/pages/teacher_home_page.dart`)
- Allows teachers to create and manage groups.
- Provides a guided section to help educators navigate features.
- Integrates Firebase Auth for user sessions and Firestore for group data persistence.
- Includes a bottom navigation bar for seamless navigation.

### 2. Student Home Page (`lib/pages/student_home_page.dart`)
- Enables students to join groups via a unique code.
- Displays joined groups and associated activities.
- Utilizes StreamBuilder for real-time group data updates.

### 3. Firebase Functions (`functions/index.js`)
- Scaffolded for future backend logic, such as custom triggers and HTTPS callable functions.

### 4. Platform Builds
- **Web:** Managed via `web/index.html` and associated Flutter build files.
- **Desktop:** Platform-specific build configurations in `linux/` and `windows/` directories, using CMake for build management.
